## Urgent Appeal: Trans woman in China Fights for Survival

As a transgender woman in China, I am facing a life-threatening situation that is putting my existence and well-being at risk. In December of last year, the Chinese government banned access to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) [1] [2] [10], resulting in the deaths of several dozen trans women[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]. A website [11] has been created to document some of their stories after they passed away.

My own family has turned their back on me. In their quest to continue their bloodline, they have gone on to have children with other partners[12]. Out of fear that I would negatively influence these children, they attempted to take my life[12]. I was able to escape their first attempt, but they have not given up on their plan to end my life. My parents hold high-ranking positions in the local government and have strong connections, making it even more difficult for me to seek help. They have gone as far as making my father's name "单烈" a forbidden tag on Weibo[13], and all reports about him are banned in China.

I am desperately seeking help and protection from both the Chinese government and my own parents. I am reaching out to anyone who can offer support in my fight for survival. The situation is extremely urgent, and I need all the help I can get. I hope this message can spread awareness of the difficulties faced by transgender women in China and lead to actions that will help those in need.

  [oiwiki.org](https://oiwiki.org) / [oiwiki.net](https://oiwiki.net))
  , continuous deployment to my personal kubernetes and S3 and cloudflare
  daily.
* [MtF Hub](https://hub.mtf.party): A Mastodon instance for male-to-female transgender

#### Contact 📧

* Email: me@vx.st / vxst@riseup.net
* GPG: [F085D7C448667DEF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxst/vxst/main/48667DEF.asc)
  * Fingerprint: F2A1 B804 3905 5888 0DFE  BBA0 F085 D7C4 4866 7DEF
  * The F085D7C448667DEF mentioned in below always means the GPG key with the
above fingerprint

* S/MIME:
  * Please import and trust the MtF Accepted Root CA and import MtF Accepted
  SMIME EV2 first:
    * [MtF Accepted Root CA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxst/vxst/main/MtF_AC_ROOT.crt)
      / [MtF Accepted SMIME EV2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxst/vxst/main/MtF_AC_EV2.crt)
    * SHA1 Fingerprint of MtF Accepted Root CA: 9F36 DB13 315E F5A1 A92C D75E
      20F5 C049 522E 7F26, it's also signed by the my GPG key metioned above
    * Normally, for iOS, you can send an Email to yourself which include the
  certificates, and it can be imported automatically when open as attachment
  * And the S/MIME certificates are:
    [me@vx.st](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxst/vxst/main/me_vxst.crt) /
    [vxst@riseup.net](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxst/vxst/main/vxst_riseup.crt)

> The only sure way to contact me is by email.
>
> If you want high E2E security, use GPG, It's pretty hard to get a key from
> pin-verified, self-destructible and tamper-detactable hardware.
>
> If you want to use S/MIME, you can use the key specified above.
>
> You can assume that even in extreme environment, anything signed using
> F085D7C448667DEF is signed by me personally. The private key only stored
> in tamper-proof, self-destructible hardwares. It's pretty impossible that
> anyone can get the private key. I will honor anything signed by this key
> unless it's revoked by a revoke certificate.
>
> I will read all the emails send to me@vx.st and vxst@riseup.net at
> least once a week. If you (using gmail, outlook and zju mail) can't
> contact me with GPG encrypted email that send to both addresses in 28 days,
> or the reply email is not signed by the F085D7C448667DEF key, you can assume
> I have been dead.

#### Situation Check

* You can send me a GPG signed and encrypted email. I will reply within 7 days
  to confirm my status.
* You can watch the [Canary](canary.md), which will stop update when I'm dead.

#### 我的联系方式：📧

* Email：me@vx.st / vxst@riseup.net, Telegram：[@thevxst](https://t.me/thevxst), Mastodon：[@vxst@hub.mtf.party](https://hub.mtf.party/@vxst)
* GPG: [F085D7C448667DEF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxst/vxst/main/48667DEF.asc)
  * Fingerprint: F2A1 B804 3905 5888 0DFE  BBA0 F085 D7C4 4866 7DEF
  * 下文所述的F085D7C448667DEF，均指代指纹为上述指纹的GPG密钥
* S/MIME:
  * 请先下载并确认信任[MtF Accepted Root CA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxst/vxst/main/MtF_AC_ROOT.crt)
    * 其SHA1指纹为9F36 DB13 315E F5A1 A92C D75E 20F5 C049 522E 7F26，同时它也经过上述GPG密钥的签名。
  * 然后下载并导入SMIME中间证书[MtF Accepted SMIME EV2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxst/vxst/main/MtF_AC_EV2.crt)
  * 然后下载并导入我的邮件证书
    [me@vx.st](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxst/vxst/main/me_vxst.crt) /
    [vxst@riseup.net](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxst/vxst/main/vxst_riseup.crt)
  * 对于iOS，需要通过打开邮件附件的方式安装证书。

> 联系我最可靠的方式是邮件，没有之一。
>
> 我会保证至少每7天阅读一次邮件，包括使用S/MIME和GPG加密的邮件；对于GPG加密的邮件，由于私钥只存在于不可仿造，多重备份并且可以自毁的硬件中，可以确定只会由我读到。对于S/MIME，几乎只会由我读到，除非发生了严重的意外事件。
>
> 如果有条件，建议使用GPG发送邮件，并且使用以上链接提供的公钥。如果我在28天内没有回复GPG加密的消息，或者回复的消息没有有效的签名，你可以认为我已离世或遭受严重意外。对GPG加密的消息，我必然会在回复时使用F085D7C448667DEF签名。如果收到了回复的消息，但没有使用F085D7C448667DEF签名，很有可能不是我本人发送的邮件。注意我不会接收由国内邮件提供方发送的邮件，例如QQ邮箱，网易邮箱和新浪邮箱等，由于我公开邮件地址并且会阅读每一封邮件，如果允许这些提供商发送的邮件进入收件箱，收件箱会被广告堆满，因此不得不进行高度严格的垃圾邮件过滤。
>
> 我会百分百地收到所有以“@gmail.com”，“@outlook.com”或“@zju.edu.cn”结尾的邮件，并且会完整阅读。
>
> 对于GPG，可以视为经过F085D7C448667DEF签署的一切内容都是我本人的内容。除非已经公开使用销毁证书销毁了这个key，我会对经过F085D7C448667DEF签署的所有内容负责。

#### 对生存状态的确认

* 您可以给我发送经过GPG签名和加密的电子邮件，我一般会在7天内回复以确认我的状态。
